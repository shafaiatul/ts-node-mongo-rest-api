### Prerequisites

**Node version 14.x**

### üîß Installing Packages

You **do not need to install** the packages separately if you already have the `package.json` file, as all required packages are listed in it.

### Simply run:

```bash
npm install

### Setup MongoDB URL

In `src/index.ts`:

```js
const MONGO_URL = ''; // DB URI
```

### Start the app

```shell
npm start
```

## Available commands

Running commands with npm `npm run [command]`

| command         | description                              |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `start`         | Starts a development instance of the app |


# üîÑ Nodemon Configuration Explained

This project uses [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) to automatically restart the server whenever changes are made to the codebase. This improves the development workflow by removing the need to manually stop and restart the server.

## üìÅ File: `nodemon.json`

This is the configuration file Nodemon reads to know how to behave when you run the app in development mode.

```json
{
  "watch": ["src"],
  "ext": ".ts,.js",
  "exec": "ts-node ./src/index.ts"
}

Key | Description
watch | Tells Nodemon to monitor the src folder. Any file change inside this folder triggers a restart.
ext | File extensions to watch. Here, it looks for .ts (TypeScript) and .js (JavaScript) files.
exec | The command Nodemon uses to run the application. Here, it runs the main file using ts-node.
